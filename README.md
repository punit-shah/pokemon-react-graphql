# pokemon-react-graphql

A Pokedex built with React and GraphQL!

Uses the [graphql-pokemon](https://graphql-pokemon.now.sh/graphql) GraphQL API.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Development

- `npm install` to install project dependencies
- `npm start` to run the app in development mode and open a local preview in your browser
- `npm test` to run tests

## Todo

- [x] Build components for each page
- [x] GraphQL queries with Apollo
- [x] Routing with ~~React Router~~ Reach Router
- [x] Unit tests for components
- [x] Styling
- [ ] ~~Routing tests~~ - this would require mounting the full app with enzyme in order to test routing, which doesn't currently seem to work
